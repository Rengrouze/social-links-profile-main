## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox

### What I learned

that was a good reminder of basic animation for changing colors

### Continued development

it could benefits for some emoji but it is more design oriented than dev work

### Useful resources

-  [CSS animation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - could be useful if you forgot how keyframes work
